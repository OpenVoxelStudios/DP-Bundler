# Datapack Bundler

Bundles multiple datapacks into one! Practical for releasing one datapack based on two or more (if you separate your animated java datapack from your main one, well this is for you).


You can EITHER manually download the code, install the dependencies and run it OR you can download the built executable in the releases tab.

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```
